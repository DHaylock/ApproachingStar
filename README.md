### Overview

Some code and a small prototype created during Juliet's Residency. 

### Software

An Arduino Sketch which measures the distance from the plinth then sends the data via the Serial Port to the Laptop.

A openFrameworks application which receives the data and translates the distance data into volume levels. 

To change the tracks press tab key then drag and drop the files in to the folder. Then change their names to ***star_one.wav*** and ***star_two.wav***
